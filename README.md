This application is a template for creating applications for organizations providing various services. As an example, a medical organization is taken. The application takes data from an SRM system written for the same purposes.

On the "Online Record" screen, user recorded to the reception. To enroll, must select a service in one of the categories, employee, date and time of the entry and enter your data.

On the "Employee" screen a full list of employees is displayed. Selecting one of them you can find out his biography, schedule, read reviews of other users or leave your feedback, and also make an appointment with this specialist.

On the "My Records" screen, you can see a list of past and upcoming appointments.

Soon the following will appear:
Personal cabinet where the user can edit information about himself.
The choice of a branch if the organization has several branches in the city.
The screen with news and shares of the company.
The basis of the architecture is the MVP pattern. Also, a singleton pattern was used to store the selected options during recording to the reception and the ViewHolder pattern to create the lists.
